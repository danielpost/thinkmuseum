Hi, I'm Nick and I love IBM typewriters. This passion hit me out of nowhere. As a kid me and my brother use to go to auctions and buy stuff to resell. Over the years we bought and sold some Selectric typewriters but we knew nothing about them. All I knew is that people were willing to pay hundreds of dollars for them and no else at the auctions was bidding on them. It wasn't until many years later when the typewriter collecting bug bit me that I really learned how cool they actually were.
